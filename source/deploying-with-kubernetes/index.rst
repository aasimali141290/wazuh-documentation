Deploying with Kubernetes
=========================

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

For more info about Kubernetes services, go to their official `site. <https://kubernetes.io/>`_

By following this guide, the users will be able to build an environment composed by a Wazuh cluster and an Elastic Stack server, all this in worker nodes of a Kubernetes cluster offering high availability and securing the data of interest.
